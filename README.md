# Travel Blog Demo

This is a Travel Blog website. I built it using React, Redux and Material UI. You can read posts on one route, and add, update or delete posts on other routes
Because it's a demo, The state is stored locally in reduxStore (changes will be lost after reloading the page).

## Run Project

After cloning, you can run the project by doing:

### `npm i`

then

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
